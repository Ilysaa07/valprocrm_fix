## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
```typescript
// Enhanced WFH Log Interface
interface WfhLog {
  id: string
  userId: string
  activityDescription: string
  logTime: string
  status: string
  createdAt: string
  screenshotUrl: string
  latitude: number
  longitude: number
  adminNotes?: string
  user: {
    id: string
    fullName: string
    email: string
    profilePicture: string | null
  }
}
```

### Key Functions
- `validateWfhLog()`: Handle WFH approval/rejection
- `toggleWfhLogExpansion()`: Manage expandable details
- `load()`: Fetch and refresh data
- `handleRequest()`: Process leave and WFH requests

### API Integration
- **GET** `/api/wfh-logs/pending`: Fetch pending WFH logs
- **POST** `/api/wfh-logs/{id}/validate`: Validate WFH logs
- **GET** `/api/admin/attendance/requests`: Get all pending requests

## User Experience Design

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Actions**: Approve/Reject buttons prominently displayed
2. **Secondary Information**: Employee details and timestamps
3. **Tertiary Details**: Location maps and admin notes (expandable)

### Interaction Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential info first, details on demand
- **Clear Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental actions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Approved actions, present status
- **Red**: Rejected actions, absent status
- **Blue**: Information, links, primary actions
- **Purple**: WFH status, special states
- **Gray**: Neutral states, disabled elements

## Responsive Breakpoints

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column layout
- Stacked action buttons
- Collapsed details by default
- Touch-optimized controls

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- Two-column grid for WFH logs
- Side-by-side action buttons
- Expanded details available
- Medium-sized touch targets

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Multi-column grid layout
- Full feature set visible
- Hover states and interactions
- Compact, efficient layout
